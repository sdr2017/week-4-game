# Crystal Collector

The perfect game for math lovers! 

A random number between 19 and 120 is generated at the start of each game. Four crystals at the bottom have a value of a random number between 1 and 12, which is unknow at the start of the game and is not listed anywhere. When a crystal is clicked, its value is added to a total. To win the game, the user must match their total to the randomly generated number. If the user goes over, the game is lost. A tally is kept of wins and losses. 

The app is built with Bootstrap for layout and JavaScript for functionality. The crystal graphics are from pixelbuddha.net.
